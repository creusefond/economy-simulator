# economy-simulator
Simulation of economic models

The aim of this project is to provide a playground to test common economics models.
This project is currently in an early development phase and is not currently in a working state.
This project is written in Python.

# Assumptions

Companies are created at the start of the simulation and no new company can arise.
We use cardinal utility functions to model preferences (linear, ).

# How it works

## Production

## Salary

## Market, exchange of goods
There is a market price that will be decided through analysis of demand (supply is fixed due to production already happening).

# Evolution ideas
Being able to set one utility function per product (would require to be more clever to compute the lagragian multiplicator - lambda).
